Below you can find an ever expanding list of Creative Coding resources and tips that I find along the way.

### Generative (Design)

#### Tutorials / Techniques

* [Flow technique deconstruction](https://martijnbrekelmans.com/generative-art/heart-deconstruction/techniques.html)

#### Books & Resources
* [Generative Gestaltung](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/code)

  Free book about generative design + processing code

* [The Art of Computer Designing (1993)](https://archive.org/details/satoArtOfComputerDesigning)
  
#### Inspiration
* [Zach Lieberman: Daily Sketches in 2016](https://medium.com/@zachlieberman/daily-sketches-2016-28586d8f008e#.gogsv0hg6)

### Web Audio

#### Books & Resources
* [Web Audio API: Advanced Sound for Games and Interactive Apps (Book)](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001552/pr01.html)

* [1st Web Audio Conference (Slides)](http://medias.ircam.fr/search/?q=WAC+-+1st+Web+Audio+Conference)

* [Circles, Signs and Signals](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/)

  Interactive introduction to digital signal processing 

#### Tutorials
* [Web Audio School](http://mmckegg.github.io/web-audio-school/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/mmckegg/web-audio-school))

#### Libraries
* [Web Audio Font](https://github.com/surikov/webaudiofont)

  >WebAudioFont is a set of resources and associated technology that uses sample-based synthesis to play musical instruments in browser.

* [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js)

  >Tone.js is a Web Audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser. The architecture of Tone.js aims to be familiar to both musicians and audio programmers looking to create web-based audio applications. On the high-level, Tone offers common DAW (digital audio workstation) features like a global transport for scheduling events and prebuilt synths and effects. For signal-processing programmers (coming from languages like Max/MSP), Tone provides a wealth of high performance, low latency building blocks and DSP modules to build your own synthesizers, effects, and complex control signals.

* [Tuna.js](https://github.com/Theodeus/tuna)

  >A audio effects library for the Web Audio API

* [NexusUI](http://nexusosc.com/)

  JS audio interface API (clickable drumpads, keyboards etc.)

#### Inspiration
* [Web Audio Samples](http://webaudioapi.com/samples/)
* [Web Audio Weekly](http://www.webaudioweekly.com/)
